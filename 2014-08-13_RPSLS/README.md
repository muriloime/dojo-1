Python North East - Code Dojo: August 2014
------------------------------------------

For this month's dojo we have chosen the [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock][RPSLS]
game proposed last month. The task was to implement the game mechanics
and an AI strategy able to compete with a human player.

Outcome
-------

We spent most of the time implementing the gameplay and struggled
a bit to finish the AI strategy on time. One of the teams have shown
their "messy but working" solution with AI countering the opponent's
last move.

__TODO__: Please add your code to the repository.
