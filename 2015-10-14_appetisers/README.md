Python North East - Code Dojo: October 2015
--------------------------------------------

This month's dojo problem was a follow up to the tutorial on evolutionary
algorithms. The task was to modify the tutorial code to solve the appetisers
problem from <http://xkcd.com/287/>.

Outcome
-------

It took a short while to adapt the code to the new problem, but due to a (then
unknown) bug in the selection function, only one person was able to find the
optimal solution. If you struggled with population diversity (all individuals
containing the same solution), revisit the updated slides, which now contain
the correct code, or check the reference solution provided here.
